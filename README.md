# project-euler

These are the various pyhton scripts I'm creating to solve the Project Euler problems, found here:

  https://projecteuler.net/
  
The answers aren't included in the scripts, but if you run them in Python 3.11, they should be outputted.

The purpose of this repo is to document my solutions, as well as demonstrate a degree of understanding of both Python and algorithms. It's not supposed to be a "help yourself to the solutions for yourself" situation - anyone is technically free to use them, but it undermines the point of Project Euler.
